A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/sebastianinman/pen/vLmNXZ.

 This started out as a spur-of-the-moment experiment. I wanted to play around with controlling an array of audio samples using only Javascript, and decided to build a simple drum machine. This is still very much a work in progress, and I plan on adding a lot more features.

Features to be added in the future:
  - Ability to change the BPM
  - Add and remove more rows
  - Add and remove new drum samples
  - Control the pitch of samples
  - Save and share your created loop
